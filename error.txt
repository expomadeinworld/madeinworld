The following assertion was thrown while finalizing the widget tree:
Multiple widgets used the same GlobalKey.
The key [GlobalKey#626ac] was used by multiple widgets. The parents of those widgets were:
- IgnorePointer(ignoring: false, renderObject: RenderIgnorePointer#61be6 relayoutBoundary=up2
NEEDS-PAINT)
- IgnorePointer(ignoring: false, renderObject: RenderIgnorePointer#815bf relayoutBoundary=up2
NEEDS-PAINT)
A GlobalKey can only be specified on one widget at a time in the widget tree.

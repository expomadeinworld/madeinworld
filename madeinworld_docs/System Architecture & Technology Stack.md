### **Recommended System Architecture & Technology Stack**

The proposed architecture is robust, leveraging a modern technology stack well-suited for a high-performance, globally distributed application. The following outlines the definitive stack and architectural principles, incorporating best practices to ensure stability, scalability, and maintainability.

#### **3.1 Definitive Technology Stack**

| Component | Technology / Service | Rationale |
| :---- | :---- | :---- |
| **Frontend (Mobile App)** | Flutter | Enables a single codebase for both iOS and Android, ensuring a consistent user experience while optimizing development resources. |
| **Frontend (Admin Panel)** | React with MUI | A powerful and widely-adopted combination for building complex, data-driven, and responsive web-based administrative interfaces. |
| **Backend Services** | Go (Golang) | Ideal for high-concurrency, high-performance microservices. Its efficiency is perfectly suited for API and data synchronization tasks. |
| **Containerization** | Docker | The industry standard for creating portable, self-contained application environments, ensuring consistency from development to production. |
| **Orchestration** | Kubernetes (AWS EKS & Alibaba Cloud ACK) | Manages containerized applications at scale, providing automated deployment, scaling, and operational resilience. |
| **Primary Database** | Managed PostgreSQL (AWS RDS & ApsaraDB for RDS) | Provides the power of a relational database with the reliability of a managed service, handling backups, patching, and scaling. |
| **Cloud Infrastructure** | AWS (eu-central-1 Frankfurt) & Alibaba Cloud (cn-shanghai) | A necessary dual-provider strategy to ensure optimal performance and regulatory compliance for both global and mainland China users. |
| **DNS & Routing** | AWS Route 53 (Geolocation Routing Policy) | The correct, mandatory choice for intelligently directing users to the geographically nearest and most performant backend cluster. |

#### **3.2 Core Architectural Principles & Refinements**

To ensure the system is "hard to go wrong," we will adhere to the following architectural pillars:

**1\. Microservices Architecture (Backend)**

Instead of a single monolithic backend, the Go application will be decomposed into several independent microservices. This enhances scalability, fault isolation, and development speed. Each service will own its domain and communicate via well-defined APIs.

* **Key Services:**  
  * Auth Service: Manages user registration, login, and session management.  
  * Catalog Service: Manages products, categories, manufacturers, and store definitions.  
  * Inventory Service: A dedicated service for the entire supply chain: Stock\_Requests, Shipments, real-time Inventory levels, and Stock\_Verifications.  
  * Order Service: Manages Carts and Orders.  
  * Notification Service: Handles the logic for notifying all stakeholders (Admin, Manufacturer, 3PL, Partner) based on events from other services.

**2\. Infrastructure as Code (IaC)**

All cloud infrastructure in both AWS and Alibaba Cloud will be defined and managed through code (using a tool like **Terraform**).

* **Why it's critical:** This eliminates manual configuration errors, ensures both the Frankfurt and Shanghai environments are perfectly consistent, and allows for rapid, repeatable deployments or disaster recovery. This is a non-negotiable principle for robust multi-region operations.

**3\. CI/CD Automation**

A fully automated CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Continuous Deployment) pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions or GitLab CI) will be implemented.

* **Workflow:** When a developer pushes code, the pipeline automatically runs tests, builds the Go binary, containerizes it with Docker, pushes the image to a registry (Amazon ECR / Alibaba Cloud ACR), and deploys the new version to the Kubernetes cluster without downtime. This minimizes deployment risk and accelerates development.

**4\. Data Management & Synchronization Strategy**

This is the most critical component of the dual-region architecture. The strategy is designed to maintain data integrity while ensuring high performance.

* **Strict Region-Locking of Transactional Data:** Data that is transactional and region-specific **must** remain in its origin database. This includes:  
  * Orders  
  * Shopping Carts  
  * Inventory levels for specific stores  
  * All logistics data (Stock Requests, Shipments, Verifications)  
  * This is essential for performance and data privacy/compliance.  
* Asynchronous Event-Driven Synchronization for Global Data:  
  A dedicated "Data Synchronizer" Go module will handle syncing essential global data. To do this reliably, it will use an event-driven pattern.  
  * **Source of Truth:** The European (AWS) cluster will be designated as the **primary source of truth for global data**. All changes to the global product catalog, manufacturer details, etc., will be made via the Admin Panel connected to the EU backend.  
  * **Synchronization Flow:**  
    1. An Admin updates a product via the React panel. The request hits the Catalog Service in the EU cluster.  
    2. The Catalog Service successfully updates its primary AWS RDS PostgreSQL database.  
    3. Immediately after the database commit, the service publishes an event (e.g., product.updated) with the product's new data to a message queue (like **AWS SQS**).  
    4. The "Data Synchronizer" service is subscribed to this queue. It picks up the event.  
    5. It then connects to the Shanghai (Alibaba Cloud) database and performs the corresponding INSERT or UPDATE operation, ensuring the record reflects the change.  
  * **Global User Profiles:** User accounts (Users table) are the main exception and require a carefully managed **two-way sync** to allow a user to change their password or profile from anywhere. The event-driven model still applies, but each synchronizer must be intelligent enough to handle events originating from either region, using timestamps (updated\_at) to prevent overwriting newer data with older data (conflict resolution).
